Release: SSD v5 GA
Released: 21 December 2017 

****************************************
OVERVIEW OF RELEASE
****************************************

Version 5 of the consolidated Services Standard Deployment (SSD) contains a number of new
components, enhancements and fixes.


****************************************
NEW TO THIS RELEASE:
****************************************

SSB: 
    - Deprecated BeanShell detection: the SSB Build Checks will now scan for deprecated
      BeanShell code against the version of IdentityIQ that is being built.  This can be 
      useful when upgrading, where the ability to automatically identify code that is 
      deprecated in the newer version of IdentityIQ can save a lot of time compared with
      doing this task manually.
    - Plugin Compiler: the build process can now automatically compile and build custom 
      IdentityIQ plugins from their source code, in addition to the auto-deployment
      functionality previously available.
    - Updates to SSB User Guide.  Please refer to this guide for more information on the
      above new features.

SSF Tools:
    - Certification Closer: a task to close off certifications where access reviews have
      reached the End Phase but have not all been completed or signed off.  The task will
      result in the certification work items being removed from certifiers' IdentityIQ 
      inboxes and the certification status being set to Complete.  Refer to the 
      Certification Closer User Guide for more details.
    - Log Level Manager: allows easy selection and setting of Log4j log levels 
      dynamically within the IdentityIQ UI.  See the Log Level Manager User Guide for more
      information.
    - Customization Plugin: provides implementers with the ability to write the logic for
      IdentityIQ rules, rule libraries and report data sources using Java rather than 
      BeanShell, with no need to restart application servers or to have access to the 
      server filesystem.  The Java classes are deployed in a plugin and the tool will 
      auto-generate stub BeanShell rules and rule libraries that call the code.  This has
      previously been difficult to achieve because plugin Java classes are loaded in a
      class loader that is separate from the default class loader used in IdentityIQ.
      Refer to the Customization Plugin User Guide for details of how to use this tool.
    - SSF Field Value Framework enhancement: a simpler, more flexible and more efficient 
      way of defining Field Value logic for Provisioning Policy fields has been 
      implemented, with the ability to define more of the logic and mappings in a Custom 
      object and reduce the need for large rule libraries that can cause performance 
      issues.  See the SSF Features and Frameworks User Guide.
    - Certification Exclusion Framework enhancement: the Certification Exclusion Framework
      provides a simpler way to define what should be excluded or included in a 
      certification, and this enhancement allows exclusion based on account (Link) 
      attributes.  For example, it is now possible to exclude or include accounts 
      depending on criteria such as whether they are disabled or if they are defined as
      service accounts, privileged accounts etc.  See the Certification Exclusion 
      Framework User Guide for details.
    - Object Exporter enhancements - the Object Exporter now allows you to filter the 
      objects that will be exported based on object names matching a defined Regular
      Expression.  Refer to the Object Exporter User Guide for more information.
 
Bugs fixed since SSD v4 GA

 - The patchdb target in the SSB was failing when the database was SQL Server
 - The Server-Specific Task Launcher and Manual Correlation Exporter were failing to 
   launch in IdentityIQ 7.2
 - The Task Resulter plugin stopped working in IdentityIQ 7.2 when the new property
   "plugins.angularSnippetEnabled" in iiq.properties was set to true.
 - The IdentityIQ Loopback Connector had a missing xhtml file that was needed for 
   configuration
 - In the Access Request Attachments tool, the supplied version of the Provisioning 
   Approval Subprocess was not attaching the identity request to approval work items
 - Deprecated code was present in the SSP Sizing Rule and Database Row Count Rule
 - The Email Approvals task was failing and approvals were not being processed when the 
   approver email address, as read from the received email, was not enclosed in chevrons
 - In the SSF Leaver workflow, an incorrect parameter was being passed to the 
   getSunsetDate method, causing it to fail
 - The SSF Role Assignment Framework was not passing the role name to a configured 
   assignment rule on the role
 - The SSF Rehire feature was failing when Attribute Synch was included in the plan 
   construction type
 - The Object Exporter was ignoring object types that do not have created or modified 
   timestamps
 - The Object Exporter was not properly handling requests to terminate the task
   
 
****************************************
NOTES
****************************************

JDK version 6 is no longer supported in this release.  Please use JDK 7 or 8.

To assist the SailPoint Support team, the version of the SSB or SSD used to build 
IdentityIQ can now be seen by accessing the ServicesStandardVersion.html file at the root
of the application (e.g. http://servername:8080/ServicesStandardVersion.html).  This
information is taken from these release notes, so please do not delete this file or move
it from its current location, and do not delete the html file that is generated during the
build process.  The page also includes a timestamp indicating the last time the build was
executed.

SSF provisioning now runs in the background by default for all the SSF features, which
means provisioning will not happen until the next time the Perform Maintenance task runs.
This is the recommended setting to avoid identity locking conflicts during identity 
refreshes.

If you are currently using a version of the SSF features and frameworks from SSD v1.1 or
earlier there is no simple upgrade procedure for these components.  An upgrade would be a
more in-depth exercise carried out by a trained and experienced IdentityIQ implementer.
